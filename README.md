# Vault Test

## Description
This is to test our project on a local system.
Vault Test simulates 2 users A and B, but will be hosted from the same system.

## Working
Local test has 2 folders - 
    1. contact_A
    2. contact_B
simulating 2 users A and B.

Both users have same contents in their folders.
The ports are hardcoded to 9988 for A and 9989 for B for simulation purposes.

## How To Run
Open seperate terminals from the 2 folders
Use the following command to run each file.
```bash
go run .
```
